This is a project from front end mentor. The goal is just to recreate the website shown, adding responsive elements for different screen sizes. This one looks very close to the actual design. The only problem with this is that some of the values are hardcoded, and I couldn't find why some of the divs would arrange in certain ways or take on unexpected values. One of the things I've seen for other solutions is using CSSGrid to prevent hardcoding, especially for the image. I'll have to look into that since I've never used CSSGrid before. Anyway, I think this looks great and really helped me understand some new CSS properties.
